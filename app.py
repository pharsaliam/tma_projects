        [The Magnus Archives](https://rustyquill.com/show/the-magnus-archives/) 
        is a horror podcast created by Rusty Quill. One of the reasons why I 
        love this podcast is the way it builds out its cast of characters.
        The animation below is a network chart of cumulative character 
        appearances and interactions over the course of the podcast. 
        Watching the video on full screen mode is recommended. 
        
        The size of the character node is proportional to the number of words
        spoken by them, while the width of the edges connecting characters is
        proportional to the "closeness" of their interactions.
        
        See the FAQ section at the end for further details.

            ##### Where did you get the data?
            
            Transcript data was sourced from 
            [here](https://snarp.github.io/magnus_archives_transcripts/).
            
            ##### How is character interaction "closeness" calculated?
            
            For interactions between characters, a pair's "closeness" score
            increased by 0.05 for each scene they appeared in together and by
            1 each time they spoke within 5 lines of each other in the scene.
            (A scene is demarcated by the click of the tape recorder.) This
            methodology was inspired by C. Suen, L. Kuenzel, and S. Gil. 2011. 
            *Extraction and analysis of character interaction networks from 
            plays and movies.* Link 
            [here](http://snap.stanford.edu/class/cs224w-2011/proj/laneyk_Finalwriteup_v1.pdf)
            
            ##### Why does character X not appear?
            
            Only characters who have appeared in three or more episodes as of
            MAG160 appear in the chart.
